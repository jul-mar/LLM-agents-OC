    "Different LLMs do similar things, what differs is how good they are in doing the task. For this simple translation obviously every LLM is able to do it. For more complex tasks you have to see which LLMs is able to do it. We will take a look at that later in the course. Personally I think of different LLMs like different employees -> some are generally smarter, some are better at a certain task and worse at another compared to other employees, at the end it comes down that we test those LLMs on the task at hand and see which ones are able to solve it. Similarly we test humans (exams, assesments centers, ...) if they are able to the task and which one does it best :)"
