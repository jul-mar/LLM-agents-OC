## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is a method in natural language processing (NLP) that combines two key components:

1. **Retrieval**: Searches for relevant documents or data (from a database, knowledge base, or other sources) based on the input query.
2. **Generation**: Uses a language model (like GPT) to generate a response by conditioning on both the input query and the retrieved information.

### Why it's useful:

Traditional language models rely only on what theyâ€™ve been trained on. RAG allows the system to pull in up-to-date or external knowledge at runtime, improving **accuracy**, **relevance**, and **factual grounding**.

### Example use case:

A chatbot asked, _"What are the latest guidelines for apllying to opencampus courses"_ retrieves official documents and uses them to generate a precise answer, rather than guessing from training data alone.
