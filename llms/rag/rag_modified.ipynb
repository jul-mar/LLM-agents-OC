Adding more and more tokens leads to more latency (i.e. it takes longer for the model to serve the user) and there could be also an information overload i.e. that the information fits into the context window but there is just too much information for the model may overlook important details. (This in the end could be only found out by testing, but personally I think in terms of information density and complexity. The german \"Bild Zeitung\" has for example a very low information density and complexity while a medical textbook has a very high information density and complexity. Hence doing Q&A over 30.000 tokens of Bild articles is definitively not the same as doing Q&A over 30.000 tokens of medical textbook pages."

The standard way was to do a key word search but with the upcoming AI era that default changed to a vector search. Therefor we need another type of model: An embedding model. An embedding model takes a text and transforms it into a vector of a certain size (e.g. 1*1048). Every text is mapped to a the same vector size. The embedding models are pretrained that they map similar texts close to each other in the vector space (so LLMs aren't the only cool models).
